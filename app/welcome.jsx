                <p>with his gallions and guns 
                   looking for the new world and the palace in the sun 
                   on the shore lay montezuma with his coca leaves and pearls 
                   in his halls he often wandered the secrets of the world 
                   and and his subjects gathered round him 
                   like the leaves around the trees 
                   in their clothes of many colors for the angry gods to see 
                   and the women all were beautiful 
                   and the men stood straight and tall
                   he offered life and sacrifice 
                   so that others could go on...
